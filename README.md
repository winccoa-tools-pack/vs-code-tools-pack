# WinCC OA Tools Pack

A small Visual Studio Code extension pack that groups useful extensions for Siemens WinCC OA development.

## Install

- From the VS Code Marketplace: search for `WinCC OA Tools Pack` (when published).
- Or install the extension pack locally by opening this folder in VS Code and using the Extensions view to `Install from VSIX` after packaging.

## Included Extensions

- `mPokornyETM.wincc-oa-projects` — WinCC OA Projects tools and viewer

You can add additional extension IDs to the `extensionPack` array in `package.json` to include more tooling.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension pack will install the bundled extensions automatically. Use the individual extension commands and UI elements provided by those extensions (for example, the WinCC OA activity bar icon from `mPokornyETM.wincc-oa-projects`).
