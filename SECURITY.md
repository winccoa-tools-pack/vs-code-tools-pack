# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in any project within the WinCC OA Tools Pack, thank you for reporting it responsibly.

## Reporting

- **Preferred:** Open a confidential report by emailing <mailto:security@winccoa-tools-pack.example> (replace with your org email) with a clear subject and steps to reproduce. Attach logs, versions and an impact assessment if available.
- **Alternative:** If you cannot email, create a new issue labeled `security` in this repository. Note that private or restricted issues require organization settings; maintainers will triage and move sensitive details to a private channel if needed.

**Important:** Replace the placeholder email address `<security@winccoa-tools-pack.example>` with your real security contact before publishing this repository or copying this `SECURITY.md` into other projects.

## Response policy

- We will acknowledge reports within 3 business days.
- Critical vulnerabilities will receive an initial response and mitigation plan within 5 business days.
- We aim to publish fixes within a reasonable timeframe and will coordinate public disclosure with the reporter.

## Disclosure

- Coordinated disclosure is preferred. Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix has been released or an agreed timeline has elapsed.
- If you are a security researcher, include contact details and allow the maintainers reasonable time to respond.

## Patches and mitigations

- When a patch is available, it will be published in the repository with a security advisory and release notes.
- We will backport fixes to supported branches where feasible.

## Acknowledgements

- Reporters who follow responsible disclosure may be acknowledged in the project security advisory and/or `SECURITY.md`, unless they request anonymity.
