## 🎯 **Git Flow Merge Strategy**

### For Feature/Bugfix PRs

- Merge to `develop` using "Squash and merge" or "Create a merge commit"
- Delete feature branch after merge
- Ensure CI/CD checks pass before merging

### For Release PRs

1. Merge to `main` using "Create a merge commit"
2. Create release tag: `git tag -a v[version] -m "Release [version]"`
3. **Important**: Create back-merge PR from `main` to `develop` to sync changes
4. Delete release branch after both merges complete

### For Hotfix PRs

1. Merge to `main` using "Create a merge commit"
2. Create hotfix tag: `git tag -a v[version] -m "Hotfix [version]"`
3. **Important**: Create back-merge PR from `main` to `develop` to sync changes
4. Delete hotfix branch after both merges complete
